To build a reasonable ground truth for our study, we analysed the whole set of controls
and vulnerabilities to manually establish a mapping among them. In particular, for
every vulnerability reported in the Enisa document, we manually identified the set of
CCM controls that can be applied to mitigate it and we created a mapping between
these two sets of entities.
